        "about": "<p>Nara Chandrababu Naidu (Telugu pronunciation: [ˈnɑːrɑː ˈtʃʌnˌdrɑː ˈbɑːbuː ˈnaɪduː]; born 20 April 1950), commonly known as CBN, is an Indian politician who is currently serving as the 13th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He holds the record of longest-serving Chief Minister in the political history of Telugu states. He is the national president of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP).</p><p>In 1978, he was elected to the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from the Indian National Congress party, and from 1980 to 1982, he served as a minister in the state cabinet. Afterwards, he switched party allegiance and joined TDP, which had been founded by his father-in-law N. T. Rama Rao. Naidu served as a TDP Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from 1989 to 1995. In 1995, he became the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh.</p><p>During his two previous terms as Chief Minister, Naidu's public image was that of a visionary economic reformer and proponent of information technology–driven economic growth. His policies brought modernisation and significant investments, particularly in Hyderabad, where he directed the founding of HITEC City, Genome Valley, HITEX Exhibition and the Financial District. He also established the Hyderabad Multi-Modal Transport System (MMTS), which was inaugurated during his tenure to improve urban mobility. Additionally, he initiated major infrastructure projects such as the Hyderabad Outer Ring Road and laid the groundwork for the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. He also had a role in national politics, first as the convener of the United Front in 1996. He supported the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) after the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, in which TDP won 29 seats, enhancing Naidu's reputation as a nationally prominent politician. In 2014, Naidu returned as Chief Minister, winning in the now-residuary (due to bifurcation) Andhra Pradesh.</p><p>In the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, Naidu's party faced an electoral setback, with TDP winning only 23 out of 175 seats. In September 2023, Naidu was arrested by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) police in Andhra Pradesh due to alleged involvement in the skills development case and was granted bail by Andhra Pradesh High Court in November 2023. In the 2024 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly election, the TDP returned to power once again in a landslide topling the incumbent YSRCP government and Naidu became Chief Minister for the fourth time.</p>"
