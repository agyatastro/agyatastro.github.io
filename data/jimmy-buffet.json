        "about": "<p>James William Buffett (December 25, 1946 â€“ September 1, 2023) was an American singer-songwriter, author, and businessman. He was known for his tropical rock sound and persona which often portrayed a lifestyle described as \"island escapism\" and promoted enjoying life and following passions. Buffett recorded many hit songs, including those known as \"The Big 8\": \"Margaritaville\" (1977), which is ranked 234th on the Recording Industry Association of America's list of \"Songs of the Century\"; \"Come Monday\" (1974); \"Fins\" (1979); \"Volcano\" (1979); \"A Pirate Looks at Forty\" (1974); \"Cheeseburger in Paradise\" (1978); \"Why Don't We Get Drunk\" (1973); and \"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\" (1977). His other popular songs include \"Son of a Son of a Sailor\" (1978), \"One Particular Harbour\" (1983), and \"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\" with Alan Jackson (2003). Buffett formed the Coral Reefer Band in 1975.</p><p> Of the over 30 albums released by Buffett, eight are certified gold and nine are certified platinum or multi-platinum by the RIAA. In total, Buffett sold over 20 million certified records worldwide, placing him amongst the world's best-selling music artists. In addition to two Grammy Award nominations, Buffett was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Musical Excellence category in 2024.</p><p> Buffett also parlayed the \"island escapism\" lifestyle of his music into several business ventures, including Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville restaurant chain, the now-defunct Cheeseburger in Paradise restaurant chain, and ventures in hotels, casinos, liquor, and retirement communities. With a net worth of $1 billion, Buffett was one of the world's richest musicians and celebrities. He was also a bestselling author. His devoted fans are known as \"Parrotheads\"</p>"
