        "about": "<p>Ellen Lee DeGeneres (/dəˈdʒɛnərəs/ də-JEN-ər-əs; born January 26, 1958) is an American comedian, actress, television host, writer, and producer.</p><p>She began her career in stand-up comedy in the early 1980s, gaining national attention with a 1986 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. She starred in the television sitcoms Ellen (1994–1998) and The Ellen Show (2001–2002). She also hosted the syndicated television talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show (2003–2022), for which she received 33 Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2021, DeGeneres announced the end of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, following multiple allegations of workplace bullying.

In 2020, she became the second-ever recipient of the Carol Burnett Award for her contributions to television.</p><p>DeGeneres has also released several stand-up specials, including HBO's The Beginning (2000) and Here and Now (2003), and Netflix's Relatable (2018) and For Your Approval (2024). She is widely recognized for hosting major awards ceremonies, including the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, and Primetime Emmy Awards.</p><p>Outside of entertainment, DeGeneres has authored four books and founded the record label eleveneleven and the production company A Very Good Production.
