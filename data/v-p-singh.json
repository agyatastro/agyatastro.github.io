He also created the Sixty-second Amendment and enacted the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Act in 1989. In 1990 the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus happened from the valley of Kashmir. Following his opposition to the Ram Rath Yatra, the BJP withdrew its support for the National Front, and his government lost the vote of no-confidence. Singh resigned on 7 November 1990. His prime ministerial tenure lasted for 343 days.</p><p>Singh was the prime ministerial candidate for the National Front in the 1991 elections, but was defeated.
