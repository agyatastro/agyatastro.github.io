        "about": "Sanjay Balraj Dutt (born 29 July 1959) is an Indian actor, playback singer and film producer who works in Hindi cinema in addition to a few Telugu, Kannada, Tamil, Punjabi films. One of the popular actors of Hindi cinema, Dutt has won several accolades and acted in over 160 films.\n Part of the Dutt family of Punjabi background, he is the son of actor-politicians Sunil Dutt and Nargis. Dutt made his acting debut with Rocky (1981), directed by his father. A career slump followed, with major exceptions being Vidhaata (1982), Naam (1986) and Thanedaar (1990). He later established himself as a star with films like Saajan (1991) and Sadak (1991) and continued to deliver hits, such as Adharm (1992), Gumrah (1993), Khalnayak (1993), Daag: The Fire (1999), Haseena Maan Jaayegi (1999), Vaastav: The Reality (1999), Jodi No. 1 (2001), Munna Bhai MBBS (2003) and Lage Raho Munna Bhai (2006), the latter of which proved to be his biggest solo commercial success till date. His critically acclaimed performance in Vaastav won him the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.\n Since 2000, his other notable films include - Mission Kashmir (2000), Kurukshetra (2000), Kaante (2002), Dus (2005), Shootout at Lokhandwala (2007), Dhamaal (2007), All the Best (2009), Double Dhamaal (2011), Agneepath (2012), Son of Sardaar (2012) and PK (2014). This was followed by another major career downturn with the exceptions of Kannada film K.G.F: Chapter 2 (2022) and the Tamil film Leo (2023), the former being the 4th highest-grossing Indian film and the latter being the 12th highest-grossing Indian film, both in which he played the main antagonist.\n Dutt was arrested under the TADA and the Arms Act in April 1993 and was convicted later for violation of Arms Act for possession of illegal weapons procured from other accused in the 1993 Bombay bombings. He was sentenced to five years in prison. He was granted bail several times during his sentence which is why he only completed his five-year jail sentence in 2016. He was granted bail in 1993, 1995, 2007, 2013, 2015, and 2016. Dutt's life receives considerable media coverage in India, and in 2018, Sanju, a biopic based on his life (which also saw a special appearance by him), starring Ranbir Kapoor as Dutt, was released to positive reviews and emerged as one of the highest-grossers of Indian cinema."
