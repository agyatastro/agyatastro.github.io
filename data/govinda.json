A leading actor throughout 1990s, he is known for his slapstick performances and dancing skills. He has received 12 Filmfare Award nominations and won two Filmfare Special Awards and one Filmfare Award for Best Comedian.\n Starting out as an action and dancing hero in the 1980s, his first film was 1986's Love 86, which turned out to be a hit.

In 2015, Govinda became a judge on Zee TV's reality show, Dance India Dance Super Moms.\nGovinda was a member of the Parliament of India from 2004 to 2009.
