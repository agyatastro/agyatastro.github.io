In later life, she was elected repeatedly to both houses of the Indian parliament. She was one of the founding members of the Bharatiya Janata Party.[6] William Dalrymple wrote in his 1998 book The Age of Kali that she had been called \"a madwoman and a saint; a dangerous reactionary and a national saviour; a stubborn and self-righteous old lunatic and a brave and resilient visionary.\"</p>",
