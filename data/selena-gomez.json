She signed with Hollywood Records in 2008 and formed the band Selena Gomez & the Scene, which released three successful albums: Kiss & Tell (2009), A Year Without Rain (2010), and When the Sun Goes Down (2011).\n Gomez has since released three solo studio albums that debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her EDM-infused debut record, Stars Dance (2013), yielded the international top-ten single \"Come & Get It\". She moved to Interscope Records and released the electropop album Revival (2015), supported by the top-ten singles \"Good for You\", \"Same Old Love\", and \"Hands to Myself\". Its follow-up, the dance-pop-influenced Rare (2020), contained her first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"Lose You to Love Me\". Gomez then released the Spanish EP Revelación (2021), which earned her nominations at the Grammys and Latin Grammy Awards. It was followed by her fourth studio album I Said I Love You First (2025), a collaborative project with Benny Blanco. Gomez has released many collaborative singles, including \"We Don't Talk Anymore\", \"It Ain't Me\", \"Wolves\", \"Taki Taki\", and \"Calm Down (Remix)\", the last of which is widely regarded as the most successful Afrobeats song of all time.\n Gomez has starred in films such as Another Cinderella Story (2008), Monte Carlo (2011), Spring Breakers (2012), The Fundamentals of Caring (2016), The Dead Don't Die (2019), and Emilia Pérez (2024). She also voiced Mavis in the Hotel Transylvania film franchise (2012–2022). Gomez has produced series such as 13 Reasons Why (2017–2020), Living Undocumented (2019) and Selena + Chef (2020–2023), and has played a lead role in Only Murders in the Building since 2021. Her accolades include an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award, a Cannes Film Festival Award, two MTV Video Music Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Award and 16 Guinness World Records.\n Gomez has worked with charitable organizations. She advocates for mental health, and gender, racial, and LGBT equality, and has been a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2009. She founded the cosmetic company Rare Beauty in 2020, valued at $2 billion in 2024, and non-profit Rare Impact Fund. She has appeared in listicles such as the Time 100 (2020) and Forbes 30 Under 30 (2016 and 2020), was named Billboard's Woman of the Year (2017), and Latin Women of the Year (2025), and was made a member of the Order of Arts and Letters by the Government of France (2024).
