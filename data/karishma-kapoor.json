        "about": "Karisma Kapoor (pronounced [kar-iz-maː kəˈpuːr]; born 25 June 1974) is an Indian actress who appears in Hindi films. One of the leading and highest-paid actresses of the 1990s and early 2000s, Kapoor is a recipient of several accolades, including a National Film Award and four Filmfare Awards. \n A part of the Kapoor family, she made her acting debut as a teenager with a leading role in the moderately successful Prem Qaidi (1991).\n The 1996 blockbuster romance Raja Hindustani marked a significant turning point in Kapoor's career, earning her praise and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She later won the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a passionate dancer in the musical romance Dil To Pagal Hai (1997). Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in three of David Dhawan's top-grossing romantic comedies—Hero No.1 (1997), Biwi No.1 (1999) and Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge (2000), and in Sooraj Barjatya's highly successful family drama Hum Saath-Saath Hain (1999)—and won the Best Actress and Best Actress Critics awards at Filmfare for her titular roles in the dramas Fiza (2000) and Zubeidaa (2001). Kapoor took a sabbatical from full-time acting in 2004, and has since acted sporadically, starring in the web-series Mentalhood (2020) and the mystery thriller Murder Mubarak (2024).\n Kapoor was married to businessman Sanjay Kapur from 2003–2016; the couple had two children together. Her off-screen life is a subject of substantial media coverage. Kapoor has played the titular character in the television series Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny (2003–2004) and has featured as a talent judge for several reality shows. Apart from her acting career, Kapoor participates in stage shows and is a prominent celebrity endorser for various products."
