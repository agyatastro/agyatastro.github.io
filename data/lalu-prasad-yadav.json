He is the founder and president of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) a prominent political party in Bihar. He is also a former member of Parliament (MP) of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.</p><p>Lalu Prasad Yadav is often regarded as a political messiah for the lower castes in Bihar, particularly the Other Backward Classes (OBCs), Scheduled Castes (SCs), and Muslim communities. His political rise in the 1990s marked a significant shift in Bihar's social and political landscape, which had long been dominated by upper-caste elites.</p><p>He entered politics at Patna University as a student leader and, in 1977, was elected as one of the youngest members of the Lok Sabha for the Bharatiya Lok Dal of the Janata Alliance. He became the chief minister of Bihar in 1990. His party came to power in the 2015 Bihar Legislative Assembly election in coalition with Nitish Kumar of JD(U). The coalition ended when Nitish resigned and the RJD was ousted, becoming the opposition party.</p><p>In the 2020 Bihar Legislative Assembly election, the RJD remained the single largest party in Bihar, and along with JD(U) in power after JD(U) rejoined MGB in 2022, headed the government until JD(U) returned to NDA.</p><p>Lalu was convicted in the controversial Fodder Scam, and was serving a term until 17 April 2021, when he was granted bail from the High Court.</p>"
