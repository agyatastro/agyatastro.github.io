        "about": "<p>Avadhut Sathe, an influential figure in the financial education space, is popular for his unconventional teaching methods, often incorporating dance, motivational speeches, and live chart analyses during sessions. He runs the Avadhut Sathe Trading Academy (ASTA) and has over 9 lakh subscribers on YouTube.</p><p>Claiming over three decades of trading experience since 1991, Sathe has built a strong following through his unique approach to financial education. His platform, ASTA, offers a variety of stock market training programs both online and offline.</p><h4>SEBI’s case against him</h4><p>In a 125-page interim order and show-cause notice, SEBI said that funds collected from customers flowed into the accounts of ASTAPL and Avadhut Sathe himself. The regulator noted that while Sathe’s wife, Gouri Avadhut Sathe, participated in administrative activities, she did not provide advisory services, the core operations were “primarily driven by Avadhut Sathe”, said a PTI report.</p><p>According to the regulator, Sathe allegedly devised a scheme where course participants were pushed to trade in specific stocks, under the impression that they were receiving education. In reality, SEBI claims, Sathe was offering buy/sell recommendations without any investment-adviser registration, and charging fees for them.</p><p>SEBI observed that Sathe and ASTAPL collected ₹601.37 crore from more than 3.37 lakh people. The academy allegedly showcased only profitable trades, creating an illusion of guaranteed high returns. Live market data and trade performance were used in marketing to lure new students. None of the entities involved were SEBI-registered investment advisors or research analysts.</p><p>SEBI’s Whole-Time Member, Kamlesh Chandra Varshney, stated that ASTAPL and Sathe are jointly and severally liable for disgorging the unlawful gains amounting to ₹546.16 crore.</p>"
