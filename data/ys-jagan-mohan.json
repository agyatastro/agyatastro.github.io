        "about": "<p>Yeduguri Sandinti Jagan Mohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), also known mononymously as Jagan, is an Indian politician, currently serving as the Member of Legislative Assembly (MLA) representing Pulivendula Assembly constituency in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative assembly. He served as the 17th Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh from 2019 to 2024, and is the current president of the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP). He is also the son of Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. </p><p> Jagan Mohan Reddy started his political career in the Indian National Congress and was elected as the Member of Parliament of Kadapa in 2009. After his father's death due to a helicopter crash in 2009, he started an Odarpu Yatra (a consoling tour) across the state. He then eventually came out of the Congress Party and established his own party, YSR Congress Party which also matches his father's acronym, YSR.</p><p> On 27 May 2012, Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on embezzlement charges. CBI summoned Reddy for allegedly amassing huge assets through illegal means by using his father's office while he was the chief minister. CBI and ED has also summoned 58 companies of investing in Reddy's businesses, for the favours they allegedly received in the form of mining leases, allotments of projects. His judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded. The Supreme Court of India dismissed his bail petition on 4 July 2012, 9 August 2012, 7 November 2012, 9 May 2013, and 13 May 2013.</p><p> In the 2014 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, YSRCP won 67 seats and he became the Leader of the Opposition. Five years later, in 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections, he led the party to a landslide victory in the state elections by winning 151 seats of the total 175 assembly segments. His party suffered severe anti-incumbency and defeat in the 2024 Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly election slumping down to a meagre 11 seats from 151 in 2019.</p>"
