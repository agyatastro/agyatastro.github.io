        "about": "<p>Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll (/ʃəˈkɪərə/ shə-KEER-ə, Spanish: [ʃaˈkiɾa isaˈβel meβaˈɾak riˈpol]; born 2 February 1977), known mononymously as Shakira, is a Colombian singer-songwriter. She has had a significant impact on the musical landscape of Latin America and has been credited with popularizing Hispanophone music on a global level. The recipient of various accolades, she has won four Grammy Awards and fifteen Latin Grammy Awards, including three Song of the Year wins.</p><p>Shakira made her recording debut with Sony Music Colombia at the age of 14. Following the commercial failure of her first two albums, Magia (1991) and Peligro (1993), she rose to prominence with the next two, Pies Descalzos (1995) and Dónde Están los Ladrones? (1998). Shakira entered the English-language market with her fifth album, Laundry Service (2001), which sold over 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album of all time by a female Latin artist. Her success was further solidified with the Spanish-language albums Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (2005), Sale el Sol (2010), El Dorado (2017), and Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran (2024), all of which topped the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart, making her the first woman with number-one albums across four different decades. Her English-language albums Oral Fixation, Vol. 2 (2005), She Wolf (2009), and Shakira (2014) received platinum certifications in various countries worldwide.</p><p>Shakira scored numerous number-one singles and other top songs worldwide, including \"Estoy Aquí\", \"Ciega, Sordomuda\", \"Ojos Así\", \"Whenever, Wherever\", \"Underneath Your Clothes\", \"Objection (Tango)\", \"La Tortura\", \"Hips Don't Lie\", \"Beautiful Liar\", \"She Wolf\", \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\", \"Loca\", \"Rabiosa\", \"Can't Remember to Forget You\", \"Dare (La La La)\", \"La Bicicleta\", \"Chantaje\", \"Te Felicito\", \"Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53\", and \"TQG\". Shakira served as a coach on two seasons of the American singing competition television series The Voice (2013–2014), had a voice role in the animated film Zootopia (2016), and executive produced and judged the dance competition series Dancing with Myself (2022).</p><p>With over 140 million records sold worldwide, Shakira is one of the world's best-selling musicians. Noted to be a \"global phenom\" whose impact has \"reached every corner of the world\", Shakira has been described as an \"artistic link between the west and the east\" for popularizing Middle Eastern sounds in the West, and western sounds in the East (mainly the Middle East). She is credited with opening the doors of the international market for other Latin artists. Billboard named her the Top Female Latin Artist of the Decade twice (2000s and 2010s). For her philanthropic work with her Barefoot Foundation and her contributions to music, she received the Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year and Harvard Foundation Artist of the Year awards in 2011. Shakira was appointed to the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanics in the United States in 2011, and Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters by the French government in 2012.</p>"
